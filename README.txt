Phaseless super-resolution in the continuous domain


A. INTRODUCTION
Phaseless super-resolution refers to the problem of super-resolving a signal from only its low-frequency Fourier magnitude measurements. In this paper, we consider the phaseless super-resolution problem of recovering a sum of sparse Dirac delta functions which can be located anywhere in the continuous time-domain. For such signals in the continuous do- main, we propose a novel Semidefinite Programming (SDP) based signal recovery method to achieve the phaseless super-resolution in the continuous domain.


B. GOALS
Extracting exact frequency locations in the continuous domain from only partial magnitude observations in the time domain
